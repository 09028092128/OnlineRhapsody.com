          <p></p>
          
          <p>When you pray in tongues, keeping your mind focussed on the subject of your prayer is very important. It’s akin to the operation of the Spirit in the stretching forth of hands in the Old Testament. For example, God told Moses to stretch forth his hand over the sea and divide it (Exodus 14:16). </p>
            <p>On several other occasions, He instructed them to stretch forth their hands to cause things to happen (Read Exodus 7:19, Exodus 8:5, Joshua 8:18). He was showing in the Old Testament that the power of God can be directed with your hands. The power goes in the direction of your hands.</p> 
            <p>But the higher level of that is the mind. Your mind does far more than the stretching forth of your hands. That’s why the pollution of the mind is one of Satan’s biggest strategies. If he can pollute your mind and make your mind ineffective, then your mind won’t be an effective tool to direct the power of God.</p>
            <p>It’s  one  of  the  reasons  God  wants  you to maintain the purity of your mind. The purer the mind, the more refined and effective it is in directing and communicating the power of the Spirit.</p>
            <p>So, when you pray in tongues, set your mind over that “thing” you want the Spirit of God to channel His energy and power to. If your mind wanders, steer it back. If the wrong picture comes to your mind, cast it off. Discipline your mind. Every so often, you say, “In the Name of Jesus, my mind is set on course!” </p> 
            <p>Of course when you pray in tongues of the Spirit, your spirit is edified, even when your mind wanders without a focus. But there’s a difference when you need  to  direct  the  power  of  the  Spirit  towards  a particular end: your mind’s vision is then required. So, in prayer, learn to set your mind on course, and your victories and testimonies will be endless. Hallelujah!</p>

In prayer, by the power of the Spirit, I exercise control over my mind, emotions and my entire faculties, to be synchronized with your will, purpose and timing, in Jesus’ Name. Amen. </strong></q></p>
