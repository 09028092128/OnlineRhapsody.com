        Maybe you desire a change in your finances, business,  health,  academics,  family  or ministry; no matter the situation is, you can create that change. Just like your heavenly Father, you can utter words and have your desires created. You can change the course of your life with words and make it conform to God’s plan for you. The Bible says you were created in God’s image and likeness (Genesis 1:26). Therefore, you have the ability to speak to things, or situations, and elicit a definite response from them. Genesis 1:3 says, <strong>“And God said, Let there be light: and there was light.”</strong> He simply commanded it to appear, and it did. 2 Corinthians 4:6 sheds more light on what happened in that instance. It says,<strong>“For God, who commanded the light to shine out of darkness, hath shined in our hearts....” </strong></p>
        <p>Also, in Genesis 1:11-12, the Bible says God spoke to the earth to bring forth grass and plants, and it did. In Genesis 1:20-21, likewise, the Bible says, <strong>“And God said, let the waters bring forth abundantly the moving creature that hath life....”</strong> He spoke to the water, and it brought forth all manner of creatures. Our theme verse says, <strong>“Through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of God, so that things which are seen were not made of things which do appear”</strong>(Hebrews 11:3). If the things which are visible to the optical eyes were made of things which are invisible, then these <strong>“invisible things”</strong>—the spoken words from our lips—must be subatomic particles.</p>
        <p>Spoken words are coded messages that create sound waves. These sound codes are thus transmitted to  the  elements,  darkness,  earth,  water—and  God elicited a definite response from each of them. The fact that these elements produced the exact things God demanded is proof that there was an interpretation of the codes sent to each of them through words.</p>
        <p>Ephesians 5:1 AMPC says, <strong>“THEREFORE  BE imitators of God [copy Him and follow His example], as well-beloved children [imitate their father].”</strong> God expects you to copy Him, to act like Him. Therefore, with your words, you can change hopeless situations. Even if you had a great life already, you can make it much more glorious by your faith-filled words.</p>

          I use my mouth to create the glorious future I want to see. Even now, I release words of prosperity, strength, grace, victories and promotions about my family, job, business, academics, health. I live in the reality of my heritage in Christ. Hallelujah!
